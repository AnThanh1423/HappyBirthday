  <div class="paper">
    <p>I love you so much, more than words could ever fully express. Every moment with you feels like a gift, and even
      the smallest things you do make my heart smile. Your presence brings me peace, your laughter lifts my soul, and
      just thinking about you fills me with warmth. You're my everything—my sunshine, my safe place, my one and only.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="paper">
    <p>Maybe when you come back, things will feel different, and there’s a chance you might not think of me the same
      way. But just know… I’m still here, quietly hoping, patiently waiting. Even if your feelings change, I’ll gently
      try to remind you of what we once had, and maybe—just maybe—I can make you smile the way I used to. You’re such a
      kind and special person, and I understand that someone like you probably has many people who admire you. But no
      matter what, my heart is still with you.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paper">
    <p>I know things have felt a bit distant between us lately, and I’m really sorry if that’s been upsetting you or
      making you feel hurt. That was never my intention. I care about you so much, and the last thing I want is for you
      to feel like I’m not here for you—because I truly am. I miss you more than I can say, and it really hurts knowing
      you're upset. I want to fix this, together. You mean way too much to me to let this distance keep growing. We
      don’t have to solve everything right away, but please know I’m here, and I want to be by your side through it all.
